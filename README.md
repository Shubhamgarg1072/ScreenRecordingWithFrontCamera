# ScreenKap

ScreenKap is a simple screen recorder app for Android.
It uses [MediaStore](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore) or [Storage Access Framework](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider) API's to access files so it doesn't require the storage permission.
